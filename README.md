# My Personal Project: Clothing E-Catalog

## A program where customers can *"buy"* clothing

## Instructions to using the program is below

**PURPOSE OF THIS PROJECT**

The aim of this project is to make a java program e-catalog having a variety of clothing pieces such as shirts, hoodies, pants, shorts.
Users can view, and make *"purchases"* of clothing.

**TARGET USERS**

Customers who seek new clothes can make clothing *"purchases"* and add stuff to their basket on this website.

The user interface includes a create account (set username & password) and login to provide multiple object/account feel.

**MY PERSONAL INTEREST IN THIS PROJECT**

Textile is a profession common in my family, I decided to reference it in my project. This project will be a combination of my interest in coding and my familiarity with textile.
